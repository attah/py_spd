# py_spd

Python program for reading and writing DDR3/DDR4 SPD EEPROM.

For use with external reder/writer "YDBS STM32 4XHH Board" from Dr.R&D (defunct? formerly on etootle.com) and clones.

## Under development
DDR3 reading is implemented, writing to follow.
Need some spare DDR4 to get that started.
